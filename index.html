        <p id="tribute-info"> Michael Collins (16 October 1890 – 22 August 1922) was an Irish revolutionary, soldier, and politician who was a leading figure in the

        <div id="bullet-list">
        <ul>
        <li>Early years: Born in West Cork, was a member of the republican Fenian movement</li>
        <li>Easter Rising: Michael Collins first became known during the Easter Rising in 1916 because of his revolutionary work.</li>
        <li>The first Irish Parliament, the Dáil Éireann: Unlike their rivals in the Irish Parliamentary Party, Sinn Féin MPs had announced that they would not take their seats in Westminster, but instead would set up an Irish Parliament in Dublin.</li>
            <li>War of Independence: he was elected president of the IRB, Director of Intelligence of the Irish Republican Army. Arrangements were made for a conference between the British government and the leaders of the as-yet unrecognised Irish Republic.</li>
            <li>Anglo-Irish Treaty: The negotiations resulted in the Anglo-Irish Treaty which was signed on 6 December 1921.The Irish Free State was established in December 1922, 
              and as expected, Northern Ireland opted to remain part of the United Kingdom proper.</li>
            <li>Provisional Government: Collins secured a compromise, "The Collins/De Valera Pact", whereby the two factions of Sinn Féin, pro- and anti-Treaty, would fight the soon-to-be Free State's first election jointly and form a coalition government afterwards.</i></li>
            <li>Civil War: Collins, who wanted to avoid civil war at all costs, did not attack them until June 1922, when British pressure also forced his hand.</li>
            <li>Death: Collins' men brought his body back to Cork where it was then shipped to Dublin because it was feared the body might be stolen in an ambush if it were transported by road. His body lay in state for three days in Dublin City 
              Hall where tens of thousands of mourners walked past his coffin to pay their respects.</li>
